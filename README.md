# ViT-U
High-pitch HCT reconstruction using ViT-U involves two distinct stages: the Vision Transformer (ViT) fills gaps in the sinogram domain, while the U-Net focuses on post-processing in the CT image domain. 

In this approach, the ViT and U-Net models are trained independently in different virtual environments (future work will integrate them together). Besides, CT reconstruction module generates the CT images from the filled sinogram.

More details will be provided soon...
