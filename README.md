# ViT-U
High-pitch HCT reconstruction using ViT-U involves two distinct stages: the Vision Transformer (ViT) fills gaps in the sinogram domain, while the U-Net focuses on post-processing in the CT image domain. 

In this approach, the ViT and U-Net models are trained independently. Besides, CT reconstruction module generates the CT images from the filled sinogram.
